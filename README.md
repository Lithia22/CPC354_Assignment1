## Project Overview:

The **3D Gasket TV Ident Animation** is an interactive animation project that demonstrates 3D transformations of a gasket shape. It includes a variety of animations such as rotations, scaling, translations, and color transitions. This project is designed to provide a dynamic and engaging user interface, allowing users to interact with the animation through customizable parameters.

## Main Features:

- **Initial Rotations:** The Gasket rotates 180 degrees to the right and left before returning to its original orientation.
- **Enlargement:** The Gasket gradually enlarges and returns to its original size.
- **Translation:** The gasket moves according to the user, including options for:
  - **No rotation** (default)
  - **Rotation around X-axis**
  - **Rotation around Y-axis**
  - **Rotation around Z-axis**

### Additional Features:
- **Subdivision:** Controls the level of tetrahedron subdivision using the `NumTimesToSubdivide` variable, adjustable via a slider.
- **Colour Properties:** Choose from custom, monochrome, or pastel colors to personalize the animation.
- **Animation Speed:** Modifies the animation's speed, adjustable between 0.5 and 2.0, with a default of 0.9.
- **Animation Scale:** Adjusts the Gasket's scale between 0.3 and 3.0, with a default value of 1.0 for normal size.
- **Start/Stop Button:** Toggles the animation on and off, pausing at the current state and resuming from where it left off when pressed again.
- **Reset Button:** Reset animation parameters to their original state and stop any running animations.
